# Test With Jest

This is a simple demonstration of how to configure and execute the Jest test runner within a Rails/React/Webpack application.

## Setup

Run `yarn` (or `bin/yarn` if you insist on doing things The Rails Way™) to install all JS dependencies.

If you intend **only** to run the Jest suite, it's really not necessary to run `bundle install`, but you can if it makes you feel better.

## Running the Suite

To execute the test suite, execute `yarn run test` at a command prompt. Your IDE might also have support for running this suite internally — check the documentation for your editor of choice. If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (as I do), there is an excellent extension simply called [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) which runs the suite automatically and displays results and/or errors inline within your test files.
